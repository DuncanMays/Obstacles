This is a program made in 2017/2018 that uses simultated evolution to navigate through an obstacel course.
It's dependancies are random, math and Pygame

Bots with neural networks guiding their actions are spawned at the beginning of the program and then wander through an obstacle course.
The ones that get the farthest stand the greatest chance of "reproducing" and creating offspring in the next generation.
The process of reproducing involves averaging the weights and biases of a bot's neural network with that of another bot.
Over time the bots improve at navigating through the obstacle course.

The left and right arrow keys can be used to scroll through the course wheras the up and down arrow keys can be used to speed up the program.
In the top left of the screen there is a representation of the neural network of the bot that got the farthest in the last generation, so you can see how the bots change over time.
